## #1: South Africa

Mettetal, E. (2019). Irrigation dams, water and infant mortality: Evidence from South Africa. Journal of Development Economics, 138, 17-40. Figure 2: Hydrodams in South Africa but instead of the river gradient, use the population density instead.

- In addition to the files provided to the class for this replication, 2020 population density data was also used for South Africa. The respective file, "zaf_pd_2020_1km.tif", is downloaded from https://data.humdata.org/dataset/worldpop-population-density-for-south-africa#

Balboni, C. (2025). In harm's way? infrastructure investments and the persistence of coastal cities. American Economic Review, 115(1), 77-116. Figure 3: Roadmap of Vietnam (not necessarily in 2010 but still replicate the road types)

- The Vietnam boundary data is gathered from https://gadm.org/download_country.html#google_vignette
- The replication used 2025 road data of Vietnam from https://download.geofabrik.de/asia/vietnam.html.
- The 2025 road data will significantly show that many roads have been constructed since 2010.
